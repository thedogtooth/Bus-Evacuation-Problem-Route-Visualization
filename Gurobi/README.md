# gurobi

This folder was created for developing some miscellaneous python files, along some solvers implementations. I tried to solve the instances along with CPLEX, but getting an academic license was pretty difficult, so Gurobi was used instead.

Still, if you don't have an academic license for CPLEX you can try to solve smaller instances.
